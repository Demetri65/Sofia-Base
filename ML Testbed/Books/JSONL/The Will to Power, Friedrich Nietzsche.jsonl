{"text": "\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "\nIn the volume before us we have the first two books of what was to be\nNietzsche's greatest theoretical and philosophical prose work. The\nreception given to Thus Spake Zarathustra had been so unsatisfactory,\nand misunderstandings relative to its teaching had become so general,\nthat, within a year of the publication of the first part of that\nfamous philosophical poem, Nietzsche was already beginning to see\nthe necessity of bringing his doctrines before the public in a more\ndefinite and unmistakable form. During the years that followed--that is\nto say, between 1883 and 1886--this plan was matured, and although we\nhave no warrant, save his sister's own word and the internal evidence\nat our disposal, for classing Beyond Good and Evil (published 1886)\namong the contributions to Nietzsche's grand and final philosophical\nscheme, \"The Will to Power,\" it is now impossible to separate it\nentirely from his chief work as we would naturally separate The Birth\nof Tragedy, the Thoughts out of Season, the volumes entitled Human,\nall-too-Human, The Dawn of Day, and Joyful Wisdom.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Beyond Good and Evil, then, together with its sequel, The Genealogy\nof Morals, and the two little volumes, The Twilight of the Idols\nand the Antichrist (published in 1889 and 1894 respectively), must\nbe regarded as forming part of the general plan of which The Will to\nPower was to be the opus magnum.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Unfortunately, The Will to Power was never completed by its author.\nThe text from which this translation was made is a posthumous\npublication, and it suffers from all the disadvantages that a book\nmust suffer from which has been arranged and ordered by foster hands.\nWhen those who were responsible for its publication undertook the task\nof preparing it for the press, it was very little more than a vast\ncollection of notes and rough drafts, set down by Nietzsche from time\nto time, as the material for his chief work; and, as any liberty taken\nwith the original manuscript, save that of putting it in order, would\nprobably have resulted in adding or excluding what the author would\non no account have added or excluded himself, it follows that in some\nfew cases the paragraphs are no more than hasty memoranda of passing\nthoughts, which Nietzsche must have had the intention of elaborating\nat some future time. In these cases the translation follows the German\nas closely as possible, and the free use even of a conjunction has in\ncertain cases been avoided, for fear lest the meaning might be in the\nslightest degree modified. It were well, therefore, if the reader could\nbear these facts in mind whenever he is struck by a certain clumsiness,\neither of expression or disposition, in the course of reading this\ntranslation.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "It may be said that, from the day when Nietzsche first recognised the\nnecessity of making a more unequivocal appeal to his public than\nthe Zarathustra had been, that is to say, from the spring of 1883,\nhis work in respect of The Will to Power suffered no interruption\nwhatsoever, and that it was his chief preoccupation from that period\nuntil his breakdown in 1889.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "That this span of six years was none too long for the task he had\nundertaken, will be gathered from the fact that, in the great work he\nhad planned, he actually set out to show that the life-principle, \"Will\nto Power,\" was the prime motor of all living organisms.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "To do this he appeals both to the animal world and to human society,\nwith its subdivisions, religion, art, morality, politics, etc. etc.,\nand in each of these he seeks to demonstrate the activity of the\nprinciple which he held to be the essential factor of all existence.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Frau Foerster-Nietzsche tells us that the notion that \"The Will to\nPower\" was the fundamental principle of all life, first occurred to her\nbrother in the year 1870, at the seat of war, while he was serving as\na volunteer in a German army ambulance. On one occasion, at the close\nof a very heavy day with the wounded, he happened to enter a small\ntown which lay on one of the chief military roads. He was wandering\nthrough it in a leisurely fashion when, suddenly, as he turned the\ncorner of a street that was protected on either side by lofty stone\nwalls, he heard a roaring noise, as of thunder, which seemed to come\nfrom the immediate neighbourhood. He hurried forward a step or two, and\nwhat should he see, but a magnificent cavalry regiment--gloriously\nexpressive of the courage and exuberant strength of a people--ride\npast him like a luminous stormcloud. The thundering din waxed louder\nand louder, and lo and behold! his own beloved regiment of field\nartillery dashed forward at full speed, out of the mist of motes, and\nsped westward amid an uproar of clattering chains and galloping steeds.\nA minute or two elapsed, and then a column of infantry appeared,\nadvancing at the double--the men's eyes were aflame, their feet struck\nthe hard road like mighty hammer-strokes, and their accoutrements\nglistened through the haze. While this procession passed before him,\non its way to war and perhaps to death,--so wonderful in its vital\nstrength and formidable courage, and so perfectly symbolic of a race\nthat will conquer and prevail, or perish in the attempt,--Nietzsche\nwas struck with the thought that the highest will to live could not\nfind its expression in a miserable \"struggle for existence,\" but in\na will to war, a Will to Power, a will to overpower! This is said to\nbe the history of his first conception of that principle which is at\nthe root of all his philosophy, and twelve years later, in Thus Spake\nZarathustra, we find him expounding it thus:--", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "\"Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even\nin the will of the servant found I the will to be master.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "\"Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to\nLife, but--so teach I thee--Will to Power!", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "\"Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of\nthe very reckoning speaketh--the Will to Power!\"", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "And three years later still, in Beyond Good and Evil, we read the\nfollowing passage:--", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "\"Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the\ninstinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic\nbeing. A living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength--life\nitself is Will to Power; self-preservation is only one of the\nindirect and most frequent results thereof.\"", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "But in this volume, and the one that is to follow, we shall find\nNietzsche more mature, more sober, and perhaps more profound than\nin the works above mentioned. All the loves and hates by which we\nknow him, we shall come across again in this work; but here he seems\nto stand more above them than he had done heretofore; having once\nenunciated his ideals vehemently and emphatically, he now discusses\nthem with a certain grim humour, with more thoroughness and detail, and\nhe gives even his enemies a quiet and respectful hearing. His tolerant\nattitude to Christianity on pages 8-9, 107, 323, for instance, is\na case in point, and his definite description of what we are to\nunderstand by his pity (p. 293) leaves us in no doubt as to the calm\ndetermination of this work. Book One will not seem so well arranged\nor so well worked out as Book Two; the former being more sketchy and\nmore speculative than the latter. Be this as it may, it contains deeply\ninteresting things, inasmuch as it attempts to trace the elements of\nNihilism--as the outcome of Christian values--in all the institutions\nof the present day.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "In the Second Book Herbert Spencer comes in for a number of telling\nblows, and not the least of these is to be found on page 237, where,\nalthough his name is not mentioned, it is obviously implied. Here\nNietzsche definitely disclaims all ideas of an individualistic\nmorality, and carefully states that his philosophy aims at a new\norder of rank.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "It will seem to some that morality is dealt with somewhat cavalierly\nthroughout the two books; but, in this respect, it should not be\nforgotten that Nietzsche not only made a firm stand in favour of\nexceptional men, but that he also believed that any morality is nothing\nmore than a mere system of valuations which are determined by the\nconditions in which a given species lives. Hence his words on page 107:\n\"Beyond Good and Evil,--certainly; but we insist upon the unconditional\nand strict preservation of herd-morality\"; and on page 323: \"Suppose\nthe strong were masters in all respects, even in valuing: let us try\nand think what their attitude would be towards illness, suffering,\nand sacrifice! Self-contempt on the part of the weak would be the\nresult: they would do their utmost to disappear and to extirpate their\nkind. And would this be desirable?--should we really like a world\nin which the subtlety, the consideration, the intellectuality, the\nplasticity--in fact, the whole influence of the weak--was lacking?\"", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "It is obvious from this passage that Nietzsche only objected to the\ninfluence of herd-morality outside the herd--that is to say, among\nexceptional and higher men who may be wrecked by it. Whereas most other\nphilosophers before him had been the \"Altruist\" of the lower strata of\nhumanity, Nietzsche may aptly be called the Altruist of the exceptions,\nof the particular lucky cases among men. For such \"varieties,\" he\nthought, the morality of Christianity had done all it could do, and\nthough he in no way wished to underrate the value it had sometimes\nbeen to them in the past, he saw that at present, in any case, it\nmight prove a great danger. With Goethe, therefore, he believed that\n\"Hypotheses are only the pieces of scaffolding which are erected round\na building during the course of its construction, and which are taken\naway as soon as the edifice is completed. To the workman, they are\nindispensable; but he must be careful not to confound the scaffolding\nwith the building.\"[1]", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "It is deeply to be deplored that Nietzsche was never able to complete\nhis life-work. The fragments of it collected in volumes i. and ii. of\nThe Will to Power are sufficiently remarkable to convey some idea of\nwhat the whole work would have been if only its author had been able to\narrange and complete it according to his original design.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "It is to be hoped that we are too sensible nowadays to allow our\nsensibilities to be shocked by serious and well-meditated criticism,\neven of the most cherished among our institutions, and an honest and\nsincere reformer ought no longer to find us prejudiced--to the extent\nof deafness--against him, more particularly when he comes forward with\na gospel--\"The Will to Power\"--which is, above all, a test of our power\nto will.", "metadata": ""}

The whole of our culture in Europe has long\nbeen writhing in an agony of suspense which increases from decade\nto decade as if in expectation of a catastrophe: restless, violent,\nhelter-skelter, like a torrent that will reach its bourne, and\nrefuses to reflect--yea, that even dreads reflection.", "metadata": ""}

Because the\nvery values current amongst us to-day will arrive at their logical\nconclusion in Nihilism,--because Nihilism is the only possible outcome\nof our greatest values and ideals,--because we must first experience\nNihilism before we can realise what the actual worth of these \"values\"\nwas....

This is the most straightforward and most sympathetic age\nthat ever was. Evil, whether spiritual, physical, or intellectual, is,\nin itself, quite unable to introduce Nihilism, i.e., the absolute\nrepudiation of worth, purpose, desirability. These evils allow of yet\nother and quite different explanations. But there is one very definite\nexplanation of the phenomena: Nihilism harbours in the heart of\nChristian morals.", "metadata": ""}

The Buddhistic feature: a yearning for nonentity (Indian\nBuddhism has no fundamentally moral development at the back of it; that\nis why Nihilism in its case means only morality not overcome; existence\nis regarded as a punishment and conceived as an error; error is thus\nheld to be punishment--a moral valuation).

The purpose above-mentioned might\nhave been achieved: in the form of a \"realisation\" of a most high\ncanon of morality in all worldly phenomena, the moral order of the\nuniverse; or in the form of the increase of love and harmony in the\ntraffic of humanity; or in the nearer approach to a general condition\nof happiness; or even in the march towards general nonentity--any sort\nof goal always constitutes a purpose. The common factor to all these\nappearances is that something will be attained, through the process\nitself: and now we perceive that Becoming has been aiming at nothing,\nand has achieved nothing. Hence the disillusionment in regard to a\nso-called purpose in existence, as a cause of Nihilism; whether this\nbe in respect of a very definite purpose, or generalised into the\nrecognition that all the hypotheses are false which have hitherto been\noffered as to the object of life, and which relate to the whole of\n\"Evolution\" (man no longer an assistant in, let alone the culmination\nof, the evolutionary process).", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Nihilism will manifest itself as a psychological condition, in the\nsecond place, when man has fixed a totality, a systematisation, even an\norganisation in and behind all phenomena, so that the soul thirsting\nfor respect and admiration will wallow in the general idea of a highest\nruling and administrative power (if it be the soul of a logician,\nthe sequence of consequences and perfect reasoning will suffice to\nconciliate everything). A kind of unity, some form of \"monism\":'\nand as a result of this belief man becomes obsessed by a feeling of\nprofound relativity and dependence in the presence of an All which\nis infinitely superior to him, a sort of divinity. \"The general good\nexacts the surrender of the individual ...\" but lo, there is no such\ngeneral good!

The moment, however, that man perceives that this world\nhas been devised only for the purpose of meeting certain psychological\nneeds, and that he has no right whatsoever to it, the final form of\nNihilism comes into being, which comprises a denial of a metaphysical\nworld, and which forbids itself all belief in a real world.

{"text": "The origin of religion.--Just as the illiterate man of to-day\nbelieves that his wrath is the cause of his being angry, that his\nmind is the cause of his thinking, that his soul is the cause of\nhis feeling, in short, just as a mass of psychological entities\nare still unthinkingly postulated as causes; so, in a still more\nprimitive age, the same phenomena were interpreted by man by means of\npersonal entities. Those conditions of his soul which seemed strange,\noverwhelming, and rapturous, he regarded as obsessions and bewitching\ninfluences emanating from the power of some personality. (Thus the\nChristian, the most puerile and backward man of this age, traces hope,\npeace, and the feeling of deliverance to a psychological inspiration\non the part of God: being by nature a sufferer and a creature in need\nof repose, states of happiness, peace, and resignation, perforce seem\nstrange to him, and seem to need some explanation.) Among intelligent,\nstrong, and vigorous races, the epileptic is mostly the cause of a\nbelief in the existence of some foreign power; but all such examples\nof apparent subjection--as, for instance, the bearing of the exalted\nman, of the poet, of the great criminal, or the passions, love and\nrevenge--lead to the invention of supernatural powers. A condition is\nmade concrete by being identified with a personality, and when this\ncondition overtakes anybody, it is ascribed to that personality. In\nother words: in the psychological concept of God, a certain state of\nthe soul is personified as a cause in order to appear as an effect.", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The psychological logic is as follows: when the feeling of power\nsuddenly seizes and overwhelms a man,--and this takes place in the\ncase of all the great passions,--a doubt arises in him concerning his\nown person: he dare not think himself the cause of this astonishing\nsensation--and thus he posits a stronger person, a Godhead as its\ncause. In short, the origin of religion lies in the extreme feelings\nof power, which, being strange, take men by surprise: and just\nas the sick man, who feels one of his limbs unaccountably heavy,\nconcludes that another man must be sitting on it, so the ingenuous\nhomo religiosus, divides himself up into several people. Religion\nis an example of the \"altération de la personalité.\" A sort of fear\nand sensation of terror in one's own presence.... But also a feeling\nof inordinate rapture and exaltation.

In short, elements of the most recent\nand most conditional origin were regarded not as evolved, but as\nspontaneously generated and \"things-in-themselves,\" and perhaps as\nthe cause of all things.... Experience teaches us that, in every case\nin which a man has means elevated the interests of the species above\nthose of the individual.

The individual was made so important and so\nabsolute, by means of Christian values, that he could no longer be\nsacrificed, despite the fact that the species can only be maintained\nby human sacrifices. All \"souls\" became equal before God: but this\nis the most pernicious of all valuations! If one regards individuals\nas equals, the demands of the species are ignored, and a process is\ninitiated which ultimately leads to its ruin.

If the degenerate and sick\nman (\"the Christian\") is to be of the same value as the healthy man\n(\"the pagan\"), or if he is even to be valued higher than the latter,\nas Pascal's view of health and sickness would have us value him, the\nnatural course of evolution is thwarted and the unnatural becomes\nlaw.... In practice this general love of mankind is nothing more\nthan deliberately favouring all the suffering, the botched, and the\ndegenerate: it is this love that has reduced and weakened the power,\nresponsibility, and lofty duty of sacrificing men. According to the\nscheme of Christian values, all that remained was the alternative\nof self-sacrifice, but this vestige of human sacrifice, which\nChristianity conceded and even recommended, has no meaning when\nregarded in the light of rearing a whole species. The prosperity of the\nspecies is by no means affected by the sacrifice of one individual\n(whether in the monastic and ascetic manner, or by means of crosses,\nstakes, and scaffolds, as the \"martyrs\" of error). What the species\nrequires is the suppression of the physiologically botched, the\nweak and the degenerate: but it was precisely to these people that\nChristianity appealed as a preservative force, it simply strengthened\nthat natural and very strong instinct of all the weak which bids them\nprotect, maintain, and mutually support each other. What is Christian\n\"virtue\" and \"love of men,\" if not precisely this mutual assistance\nwith a view to survival, this solidarity of the weak, this thwarting of\nselection? What is Christian altruism, if it is not the mob-egotism of\nthe weak which divines that, if everybody looks after everybody else,\nevery individual will be preserved for a longer period of time?... He\nwho does not consider this attitude of mind as immoral, as a crime\nagainst life, himself belongs to the sickly crowd, and also shares\ntheir instincts.... Genuine love of mankind exacts sacrifice for\nthe good of the species--it is hard, full of self-control, because\nit needs human sacrifices.

This is a\nmerely psychological point of view, based upon the false assumption\nthat nothing belongs to us which we have not consciously willed. The\nwhole of the teaching of responsibility relies upon the ingenuous\npsychological rule that the will is the only cause, and that one must\nhave been aware of having willed in order to be able to regard one's\nself as a cause.", "metadata": ""}

I even intend to prove that in order to desire this\none thing--the dominion of virtue--the other must be systematically\navoided; that is to say, one must renounce all hopes of becoming\nvirtuous. This sacrifice is great: but such an end is perhaps a\nsufficient reward for such a sacrifice. And even greater sacrifices!...\nAnd some of the most famous moralists have risked as much. For these,\nindeed, had already recognised and anticipated the truth which is to\nbe revealed for the first time in this treatise: that the dominion of\nvirtue is absolutely attainable only by the use of the same means\nwhich are employed in the attainment of any other dominion, in any case\nnot by means of virtue itself....", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "As I have already said, this treatise deals with the politics of\nvirtue: it postulates an ideal of these politics; it describes it as it\nought to be, if anything at all can be perfect on this earth. Now, no\nphilosopher can be in any doubt as to what the type of perfection is\nin politics; it is, of course, Machiavellianism. But Machiavellianism\nwhich is pur, sans mélange, cru, vert, dans toute sa force, dans\ntoute son âpreté, is superhuman, divine, transcendental, and can\nnever be achieved by man--the most he can do is to approximate it.\nEven in this narrower kind of politics--in the politics of virtue--the\nideal never seems to have been realised. Plato, too, only bordered\nupon it. Granted that one have eyes for concealed things, one can\ndiscover, even in the most guileless and most conscious moralists\n(and this is indeed the name of these moral politicians and of the\nfounders of all newer moral forces), traces showing that they too paid\ntheir tribute to human weakness. They all aspired to virtue on their\nown account--at least in their moments of weariness; and this is the\nleading and most capital error on the part of any moralist--whose duty\nit is to be an immoralist in deeds. That he must not exactly appear\nto be the latter, is another matter. Or rather it is not another\nmatter: systematic self-denial of this kind (or, expressed morally:\ndissimulation) belongs to, and is part and parcel of, the moralist's\ncanon and of his self-imposed duties: without it he can never attain\nto his particular kind of perfection. Freedom from morality and from\ntruth when enjoyed for that purpose which rewards every sacrifice: for\nthe sake of making morality dominate--that is the canon. Moralists\nare in need of the attitudes of virtue, as also of the attitudes of\ntruth; their error begins when they yield to virtue, when they lose\ncontrol of virtue, when they themselves become moral or true. A\ngreat moralist is, among other things, necessarily a great actor; his\nonly danger is that his pose may unconsciously become a second nature,\njust like his ideal, which is to keep his esse and his operari\napart in a divine way; everything he does must be done sub specie\nboni--a lofty, remote, and exacting ideal! A divine ideal!

Vice is not a cause; it is an effect. ... Vice is a somewhat\narbitrary-epitome of certain effects resulting from physiological\ndegeneracy.

Whence this hemiplegia of virtue, the invention of the\ngood man? The object seems to be to make man amputate those instincts\nwhich enable him to be an enemy, to be harmful, to be angry, and to\ninsist upon revenge.... This unnaturalness, then, corresponds to that\ndualistic concept of a wholly good and of a wholly bad creature (God,\nSpirit, Man); in the first are found all the positive, in the second\nall the negative forces, intentions, and states. This method of valuing\nthus believes itself to be \"idealistic\"; it never doubts that in its\nconcept of the \"good man,\" it has found the highest desideratum.

The interpretation by means of which the Christian sinner\ntries to understand himself, is an attempt at justifying his lack of\npower and of self-confidence: he prefers to feel himself a sinner\nrather than feel bad for nothing: it is in itself a symptom of decay\nwhen interpretations of this sort are used at all. In some cases the\nbungled and the botched do not look for the reason of their unfortunate\ncondition in their own guilt (as the Christian does), but in society:\nwhen, however, the Socialist, the Anarchist, and the Nihilist are\nconscious that their existence is something for which some one must\nbe guilty, they are very closely related to the Christian, who also\nbelieves that he can more easily endure his ill ease and his wretched\nconstitution when he has found some one whom he can hold responsible\nfor it. The instinct of revenge and resentment appears in both\ncases here as a means of enduring life, as a self-preservative measure,\nas is also the favour shown to altruistic theory and practice. The\nhatred of egoism, whether it be one's own (as in the case of the\nChristian), or another's (as in the case of the Socialists), thus\nappears as a valuation reached under the predominance of revenge; and\nalso as an act of prudence on the part of the preservative instinct\nof the suffering, in the form of an increase in their feelings of\nco-operation and unity.... At bottom, as I have already suggested,\nthe discharge of resentment which takes place in the act of judging,\nrejecting, and punishing egoism (one's own or that of others) is\nstill a self-preservative measure on the part of the bungled and the\nbotched. In short: the cult of altruism is merely a particular form of\negoism, which regularly appears under certain definite physiological\ncircumstances.", "metadata": ""}

The same holds good of the Christian: he curses,\ncondemns, and slanders the \"world\"--and does not even except himself.\nBut that is no reason for taking him seriously.

Up to the present,\npeople have trusted their concepts generally, as if they had been a\nwonderful dowry from some kind of wonderland: but they constitute\nthe inheritance of our most remote, most foolish, and most intelligent\nforefathers. This piety towards that which already exists in us\nis perhaps related to the moral element in science.

Since Plato, philosophy has lain under the dominion of\nmorality. Even in Plato's predecessors, moral interpretations play a\nmost important rôle (Anaximander declares that all things are made to\nperish as a punishment for their departure from pure being; Heraclitus\nthinks that the regularity of phenomena is a proof of the morally\ncorrect character of evolution in general).", "metadata": ""}

In that direction, alone, where a creative attitude of\nmind prevails, an attitude of mind which does not regard the world\nof happiness and repose, the \"Sabbath of Sabbaths\" as an end to be\ndesired, and which, even in peace, honours the means which lead to new\nwars; an attitude of mind which would prescribe laws for the future,\nwhich for the sake of the future would treat everything that exists\nto-day with harshness and even tyranny; a daring and \"immoral\" attitude\nof mind, which would wish to see both the good and the evil qualities\nin man developed to their fullest extent, because it would feel itself\nable to put each in its right place--that is to say, in that place in\nwhich each would need the other. But what prospect has he of finding\nwhat he seeks, who goes in search of philosophers to-day? Is it not\nprobable that, even with the best Diogenes-lantern in his hand, he will\nwander about by night and day in vain? This age is possessed of the\nopposite instincts. What it wants, above all, is comfort; secondly,\nit wants publicity and the deafening din of actors' voices, the big\ndrum which appeals to its Bank-Holiday tastes; thirdly, that every\none should lie on his belly in utter subjection before the greatest\nof all lies--which is \"the equality of men\"--and should honour only\nthose virtues which make men equal and place them in equal positions.\nBut in this way, the rise of the philosopher, as I understand him, is\nmade completely impossible--despite the fact that many may regard the\npresent tendencies as rather favourable to his advent. As a matter of\nfact, the whole world mourns, to-day, the hard times that philosophers\nused to have, hemmed in between the fear of the stake, a guilty\nconscience, and the presumptuous wisdom of the Fathers of the Church:\nbut the truth is, that precisely these conditions were ever so much\nmore favourable to the education of a mighty, extensive, subtle,\nrash, and daring intellect than the conditions prevailing to-day. At\npresent another kind of intellect, the intellect of the demagogue, of\nthe actor, and perhaps of the beaver- and ant-like scholar too, finds\nthe best possible conditions for its development. But even for artists\nof a superior calibre the conditions are already far from favourable:\nfor does not every one of them, almost, perish owing to his want of\ndiscipline? They are no longer tyrannised over by an outside power--by\nthe tables of absolute values enforced by a Church or by a monarch:\nand thus they no longer learn to develop their \"inner tyrant,\" their\nwill. And what holds good of artists also holds good, to a greater\nand more fatal degree, of philosophers. Where, then, are free spirits\nto be found to-day? Let any one show me a free spirit to-day!", "metadata": ""}
